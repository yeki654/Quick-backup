# QuickBackup üî•

QuickBackup is a lightweight **Termux** backup tool for Android that:
- Creates **password-protected RAR** archives of chosen folders.
- **Base64 encodes** the archive for safer transport/storage (`*.rar.b64`).
- Restores backups by decoding and extracting with the original password.
- Supports saving/restoring to:
  - Internal Storage (`/sdcard`)
  - Termux Home (`~`)
  - External SD Card (if detected)
- No root required

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If no password is provided at backup/restore, a default password `QuickBackup` is used.

## Features
- Colorful interactive menu and nice logo for terminal UX.
- Smart installer (`install.sh`) that checks & installs missing dependencies.
